# p2pit

p2pit is a simple library that you can drop into a Python app
to discover peers who are on the same network as you.

Or it will be, eventually. Right now it's just an idea that's
half-cooked.

## Getting started

    # Create a venv, install the apps and run the tests
    make test

    # Install the commit hook
    make dev

    # Open in VS code
    code .

    # or just run the demo app
    # make demo -- no demo yet!
